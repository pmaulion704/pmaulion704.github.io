				<div class="f5 black mt0 mb4 lh-double">
					Preqin Pro was the main project I worked on as a UX Designer at Preqin. Preqin Pro is a SaaS-based platform that is geared toward institutional investors, fund managers, and service providers by providing key insights and updates on the alternative assets space. Whether you are an asset manager seeking investors to jump-start your next fund or a public pension fund looking to allocate more capital to real estate, Preqin Pro inform users about new and developing market opportunities. Aside from modernizing the look of the platform, we needed to reassess various user flows of the existent platform and fully incorporate a responsive layout (Desktop &#8594; Tablet) to establish a more unified digital experience.

				<div class="f5 black-50 tracked mv4">PART 1 • SEARCH</div>
				<div class="f5 black mt0 mb4 lh-double">
					<p class="b">RESEARCH &amp; STRATEGY</p>
					<p>According to user heat maps &amp; data analytics, the quick search field was the No. 1 (41.2%) clicked element on the site after user logging into the platform. The main reason for a redesign of our Search was that our original user flow contained an intermediate step which made the user select what type of profile they wanted to view according to asset class. User interviews have consistently told us that they simply want to quickly search for a specific profile in mind and immediately enter a profile view to analyze, gather, or export data.</p>

					<!-- Heatmap -->
					<img class="mv4" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/pra1se/image/upload/v1525465730/heatmap_yyduob.jpg">

					<p class="b">ITERATIONS</p>
					<p>The first iteration of quick search focused on implementing text-string matching and establishing a grouping hierarchy to clearly guide what the user is searching for. However, user feedback stated that since our grouping structure was displayed vertically, search values of interest often risked being hidden beneath the fold, unless they typed out their query to completion. Another common feedback was that the View All button, which expanded the container group to show more than 4 results, was rarely clicked and did not serve much purpose. <br><br>
					The second iteration of quick search addressed this ‘content below the fold’ feedback by conglomerating all of the search results in an ‘All’ tab and allowing the user to transition to a specific category via the horizontal tab structure. Furthermore, with the tabs shown horizontally, we were able to gain more vertical real estate since we no longer need to account for category grouping, and able to view all relevant results without clicking 'View All.</p>

				<div class="f5 black-50 tracked mv4">PART 2 • PROFILE</div>
				<div class="f5 black mt0 mb4 lh-double">
					<p class="b">RESEARCH &amp; STRATEGY</p>
					<p>The profile view of an investor or fund manager is the main end-point for our users to analyze and export data. As seen on our original quick search user flow, each profile (ie. New York City's Employement Retirement System) is dissected into sub-profiles according to asset class which customers have provided frustrating feedback on opening several tabs at once just to view a single profile. The main goals behind the profile redesign were to:
						<ul class="pl4">
							<li class="mv2">Consolidate all the asset classes into one page</li>
							<li class="mv2">Increase navigability and findability of datasets according to asset class</li>
							<li class="mv2">Simplify 'action' journeys within a profile</li>
							<li CLASS="mv2">Redesign data sections to be responsive from Desktop &#8594; Tablet</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="b">REDEFINE SIDE NAVIGATION AND PROFILE FRAMEWORK</p>
					<p>On the original profile view, the left hand navigation previously had no connection to the profile at all. All of the elements within the side navigation led the user away from the profile page to different advance searches (also another component that has been repeatedly duplicated). In order to jump to a particular dataset within the profile, the user has to click on the grey-colored accordion dropdowns to open and close datasets. The side navigation has been a pain point for users since it does not add any value while you are viewing a profile, and we received feedback from initial user testing sessions that users want to see the data available all at once without having to hide and expand sections.</p>

					<img id="pro-img-1" class="mv4 pointer" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/pra1se/image/upload/v1525691752/PREVIOUS_LAYOUT_gfu45h.jpg">

					<p>Our approach was to redesign the side navigation by having asset classes associated with the profile on the left with child sub-sections featuring a particular dataset. In regard to the body section of the profile, we went with a tile format in which each dataset (<i>Investment Overview</i>, <i>Background</i>, <i>Fund Portfolio</i>, etc.) has its own dedicated tile. The side navigation is responsive whenever the user scrolls vertically through the page, and serves as a quick access point if the user wants to jump between asset classes.</p>

					<p class="b">SIMPLIFYING PROFILE TASKS</p>
					<p>When it came to profile tasks such as downloading a profile to a PDF or adding a profile to a target list we noticed that all of the available options were placed on the top right corner, and according to user analytics we observed that rarely any of the options were actually clicked. Furthermore, we noticed the previous 'Add to Target List' userflow was restricted at times since you could only add to a profile one at a time, and that adding profiles would take the user out of the profile view. <br><br>By communicating with product owners and business analysts, we simplified the amount of actions from 9 to 3 (add a profile to a list, print and send feedback). We also decided to incorporate a modal for adding profiles to a list where users can quickly add the profile to other lists or create one from scratch. Having the 'Add to List' profile action within a modal allows our users to quickly transition between performing a task and viewing the profile.</p>

				<div class="f5 black mt0 mb5 lh-double">
					<p class="b">RESPONSIVE DESIGN</p>
					<p>Before Preqin Pro, the our website did not contain any responsive breakpoints when the user resized the browser width or viewing our platform across digital devices. For Pro, we decided to establish 3 breakpoints for all future design work: 1920px, 1200px and 768px. These breakpoints would account across multiple devices from HD displays to desktop to tablet view. In regards to the profile, I was involved in designing multiple profile datasets ('tiles') across the three main breakpoints in order to provide a consistent experience to the user.</p>

				<div class="f5 black-50 tracked mt5">PART 3 • ADVANCED SEARCH</div>
				<div class="f5 black mt0 mb5 lh-double">
					<p class="b">RESEARCH &amp; STRATEGY</p>
					<p> Recalling back to the redesign of the side navigation for Profile View, we needed to rethink the whole concept of Advanced Search since every component on our current platform led to a mini-advanced search. Each 'mini-advanced search' contains a closed-accordion structure of tabs where the user has to expand each tab and select filters, followed by clicking the 'Search' button. Once the user has clicked 'Search', the user is taken to the results page based on the criteria that they have selected. A common pain-point was widening / narrowing the scope of their advanced search since the user had to jump back and forth between the criteria and results page.

					<img class="mb4" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/pra1se/image/upload/v1528250586/Artboard_7_ovzfng.png">

					Our key objectives for a redesign of the advanced search were to: 
						<ul>
							<li class="mv2">Consolidate the mini-advanced searches into one area</li>
							<li class="mv2">Createa a dynamic environment to easily filter and view results</li>
						</ul>

				<div class="f5 black-50 tracked mt5">NEW USER-FLOW</div>
				<div class="f5 black mt0 mb4 lh-double">
					<p>For Preqin Pro, we consolidated all the functionalities from the mini-advance searches into one area. The landing page of our new consolidated Advance Search area directs the user to select a particular category or load an existing saved search. After selecting a category, a table grid will appear showing all available results within that particular universe, and have filters along the side navigation and above the results table where the user can narrow down their results either by asset class or specific criteria such as location, strategies, or assets under management. As the user applies / removes filters, the result grid will dynamically change on selection which streamlines the previous user flow of transitioning back and forth between criteria selection and result pages. Furthermore, the column grids are now customizable where the user can manually select which columns to show and hide via the 'Manage Columns' option.</p>
